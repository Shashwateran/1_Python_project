# Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles. This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts in Canada.

The data sourced from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python) which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

# The Questions

Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

1. What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying) 

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:
    - **Pandas Library:** This was used to analyze the data. 
    - **Matplotlib Library:** I visualized the data.
    - **Seaborn Library:** Helped me create more advanced visuals. 
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for executing my Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data

I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

## Filter Canada Jobs

To focus my analysis on the Canada job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the Canada.

```python
df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'Canada']

```

# The Analysis

Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig , ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)
sns.set_theme(style= 'ticks')

for i , title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_merged[df_merged['job_title_short'] == title].head(5)
    sns.barplot(data= df_plot, x = 'skills %', y = 'job_skills', ax = ax[i], hue = 'value counts', palette= 'dark:g', legend= False)
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].set_title(title, fontweight = 'bold')
    ax[i].set_xlim(0, 75)
    
    
    for n , v in enumerate(df_plot['skills %']):
        ax[i].text(v+1, n + 0.1, f'{v:.0f}%', va ='center')

    if i != len(job_titles) - 1:
        ax[i].set_xticks([])

    
    
fig.suptitle(f'Likelihood of Skills Requested in the Canada Job Postings({country})', fontweight ='bold', fontsize = 18)
fig.tight_layout()
```

### Results

- Both show relatively stable demand throughout the year with some fluctuations but remain essential skill for data analysts. Power BI, while less demanded compared to the others, shows a more downwards trend towards the year's end.

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in the Canada and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis](Project/4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb).

#### Visualize Data 

```python
sns.boxplot(data= df_CA_plot, x = 'salary_year_avg' , y = 'job_title_short' , hue= 'job_title_short', palette= 'light:g_r', order= sorted_6)
ax = plt.gca()
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))
plt.xlim(0,300000)
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary (USD) ')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.title('Salary Comparison of Top 6 Jobs in Canada', fontweight = 'bold')
plt.show()
```

#### Results

#### Insights

- There's a significant variation in salary ranges across different job titles. Machine Learning Enginner positions tend to have the highest salary potential, with up to $262K, indicating the high value placed on advanced data skills and experience in the industry.

- Data Engineer and Data Analyst roles show a considerable number of outliers on the salary spectrum, suggesting that exceptional skills or circumstances can lead to high pay in these roles. In contrast, Data Scientist roles demonstrate more consistency in salary, with fewer outliers.

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts

Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on data analyst roles. I looked at the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase these.

#### Visualize Data

```python

fig , ax = plt.subplots(2,1)
sns.set_theme(style = 'ticks')

for i , dataf in enumerate(plot_list):
    sns.barplot(data= dataf, x = 'median', y = dataf.index , ax=ax[i], hue = 'median', palette= 'dark:g', legend = False)
    ax[0].set_title('Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts       (CANADA)', fontweight = 'bold')
    ax[1].set_title('Top 10 In-demand Skills for Data Analysts', fontweight = 'bold')
    ax[0].set_xlabel('')
    ax[1].set_xlabel('Median (USD)')
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))
    ax[1].set_xlim(ax[0].get_xlim())

fig.tight_layout()
 

plt.show()

```

#### Results
Here's the breakdown of the highest-paid & most in-demand skills for data analysts in Canada:

![The Highest Paid & Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in the Canada](Project/Images/High_paid_skills.png)
*Two separate bar graphs visualizing the highest paid skills and most in-demand skills for data analysts in the Canada.*

#### Insights:

## 4. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts?

To identify the most optimal skills to learn ( the ones that are the highest paid and highest in demand) I calculated the percent of skill demand and the median salary of these skills. To easily identify which are the most optimal skills to learn. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [5_Optimal_Skills](Project/5_Optimal_skills.ipynb).

#### Visualize Data

```python
from adjustText import adjust_text
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
text = []
sns.scatterplot(df_ca_plot, x = 'job %', y = 'median_salary', hue= 'technology')

for i, x in enumerate(df_ca_plot['job_skills']):
    text.append(plt.text(df_ca_plot['job %'].iloc[i], df_ca_plot['median_salary'].iloc[i], x))
plt.show()

```

#### Results

![Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in the Canada](Project/Images/optimal_skills_for_data_analysts.png)    
*A scatter plot visualizing the most optimal skills (high paying & high demand) for data analysts in the Canada.*

- Skills such as `Python`, `Tableau`, and `SQL` are towards the higher end of the salary spectrum while also being fairly common in job listings, indicating that proficiency in these tools can lead to good opportunities in data analytics.

### Visualizing Different Techonologies

Let's visualize the different technologies as well in the graph. We'll add color labels based on the technology (e.g., {Programming: Python})

#### Visualize Data

```python
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter

# Create a scatter plot
scatter = sns.scatterplot(
    data=df_DA_skills_tech_high_demand,
    x='skill_percent',
    y='median_salary',
    hue='technology',  # Color by technology
    palette='bright',  # Use a bright palette for distinct colors
    legend='full'  # Ensure the legend is shown
)
plt.show()

```
